##Introduction

Feed for pending comments is a simple WordPress plugin that generates a feed for comments awaiting approval. Why is it required? I don't see any reason as to why it would be useful now. But, I made it so that it could be used with IFTTT (If This Then That). By using this plugin and IFTTT's Feed To SMS recipe, I was able to receive SMS whenever someone commented on my WordPress site.
